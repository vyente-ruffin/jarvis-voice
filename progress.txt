# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Pre-Integration Notes

### Source Modules (from ../src/)
- memory_client.py - Async HTTP client for jarvis-cloud API
- memory_tools.py - Voice Live function tool definitions
- tool_handler.py - Routes function calls to memory client
- logging_config.py - Structured JSON logging

### Target Structure
- src/server.py - FastAPI WebSocket server
- src/voice_live.py - Azure Voice Live SDK wrapper
- src/static/ - Frontend files

### API Verified
- Memory API: https://mem0-api.greenstone-413be1c4.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
- All memory modules tested with 126 passing tests

### MCP Server Requirements
- Code/Library docs → Context7 MCP server ONLY
- Microsoft/Azure docs → Microsoft Learn MCP server ONLY
- Azure operations → Azure MCP server ONLY
- Playwright testing → Context7 for Playwright docs

## Completed Stories

### US-001 - Copy memory modules into jarvis-voice ✅

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001 Copy Memory Modules
- What was implemented: Copied 4 memory modules from ../src/ to ./src/
- Files changed:
  - src/memory_client.py (added)
  - src/memory_tools.py (added)
  - src/tool_handler.py (added)
  - src/logging_config.py (added)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Files were already present (copied in a previous session) - verified via diff
  - Use python3 not python on this system
  - Run mypy on specific files to avoid pre-existing type errors in voice_live.py/server.py
  - Pre-existing test failures exist due to Azure SDK import issues (not related to memory modules)
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002 Update requirements.txt
- What was implemented: Verified httpx and python-dotenv are already in requirements.txt
- Files changed: None (dependencies already present)
  - httpx==0.27.0 already in requirements.txt (>= 0.25.0 requirement)
  - python-dotenv==1.2.1 already in requirements.txt (>= 1.0.0 requirement)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use pip3 not pip on this system
  - Requirements were already sufficient from the original project setup
  - Focus typecheck on specific modules to avoid pre-existing issues
