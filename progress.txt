# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Pre-Integration Notes

### Source Modules (from ../src/)
- memory_client.py - Async HTTP client for jarvis-cloud API
- memory_tools.py - Voice Live function tool definitions
- tool_handler.py - Routes function calls to memory client
- logging_config.py - Structured JSON logging

### Target Structure
- src/server.py - FastAPI WebSocket server
- src/voice_live.py - Azure Voice Live SDK wrapper
- src/static/ - Frontend files

### API Verified
- Memory API: https://mem0-api.greenstone-413be1c4.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
- All memory modules tested with 126 passing tests

### MCP Server Requirements
- Code/Library docs → Context7 MCP server ONLY
- Microsoft/Azure docs → Microsoft Learn MCP server ONLY
- Azure operations → Azure MCP server ONLY
- Playwright testing → Context7 for Playwright docs

## Completed Stories

### US-001 - Copy memory modules into jarvis-voice ✅

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001 Copy Memory Modules
- What was implemented: Copied 4 memory modules from ../src/ to ./src/
- Files changed:
  - src/memory_client.py (added)
  - src/memory_tools.py (added)
  - src/tool_handler.py (added)
  - src/logging_config.py (added)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Files were already present (copied in a previous session) - verified via diff
  - Use python3 not python on this system
  - Run mypy on specific files to avoid pre-existing type errors in voice_live.py/server.py
  - Pre-existing test failures exist due to Azure SDK import issues (not related to memory modules)
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002 Update requirements.txt
- What was implemented: Verified httpx and python-dotenv are already in requirements.txt
- Files changed: None (dependencies already present)
  - httpx==0.27.0 already in requirements.txt (>= 0.25.0 requirement)
  - python-dotenv==1.2.1 already in requirements.txt (>= 1.0.0 requirement)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use pip3 not pip on this system
  - Requirements were already sufficient from the original project setup
  - Focus typecheck on specific modules to avoid pre-existing issues
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003 Extract user_id from WebSocket connection
- What was implemented: Added user_id extraction from WebSocket query params
- Files changed:
  - src/server.py (added parse_qs import, user_id extraction logic, pass user_id to session)
  - src/voice_live.py (added user_id parameter to __init__)
  - tests/test_server.py (tests were already present for user_id extraction)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use websocket.scope.get("query_string", b"") to get raw query string
  - parse_qs returns lists, so access with [0] for single values
  - VoiceLiveSession needed user_id param added for future function call handling
  - All 15 server tests pass including 3 user_id-specific tests
  - Pre-existing mypy errors in voice_live.py don't block functionality
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004 Add memory tools to VoiceLiveSession
- What was implemented: Added memory function calling tools to Voice Live session configuration
- Files changed:
  - src/voice_live.py (added FunctionTool/ToolChoiceLiteral imports, MEMORY_TOOLS import, tools param, tool conversion, updated instructions)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Azure Voice Live SDK uses FunctionTool objects, not raw dicts - must convert MEMORY_TOOLS
  - ToolChoiceLiteral.AUTO enables automatic tool selection
  - Import Tool as base type for list annotation: `list[Tool]`
  - RequestSession accepts `tools` and `tool_choice` parameters
  - Pre-existing mypy errors are about None checks, not the new tool code
  - All 15 server tests still pass after changes
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005 Handle function call events in voice_live.py
- What was implemented: Added function call event handling to VoiceLiveSession
- Files changed:
  - src/voice_live.py (added json import, FunctionCallOutputItem/ItemType imports, tool_handler import, _pending_function_call state, on_function_call callback, CONVERSATION_ITEM_CREATED handler, RESPONSE_FUNCTION_CALL_ARGUMENTS_DONE handler, _execute_function_call method)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Azure Voice Live SDK function call flow:
    1. CONVERSATION_ITEM_CREATED with ItemType.FUNCTION_CALL gives name, call_id, item.id
    2. RESPONSE_FUNCTION_CALL_ARGUMENTS_DONE gives the arguments JSON string
    3. After processing, send FunctionCallOutputItem via conversation.item.create
    4. Call response.create() to trigger the AI to continue with the result
  - Arguments come as a JSON string that needs json.loads()
  - Memory functions need user_id injected since AI doesn't know it - inject in _execute_function_call
  - FunctionCallOutputItem requires call_id and output (JSON string)
  - conversation.item.create needs previous_item_id to maintain order
  - Pre-existing mypy errors (lines 101, 106, 140, 173) are all about None checks, not new code
  - All 15 server tests still pass
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006 Update frontend to send user_id
- What was implemented: Added user_id to WebSocket connection and UI display
- Files changed:
  - src/static/js/user-id.js (added - copied from ../static/js/)
  - src/static/index.html (added user-id.js script, added user-id-suffix display element)
  - src/static/app.js (modified connectWebSocket to use buildWebSocketUrl, call displayUserIdInElement in init)
  - src/static/styles.css (added .user-id-display and #user-id-suffix styles)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Static files are in src/static/ not just static/
  - Create js/ subdirectory for additional scripts
  - user-id.js provides getUserId(), getUserIdSuffix(), buildWebSocketUrl(), displayUserIdInElement()
  - Script must be included before app.js so functions are available
  - All 15 server tests still pass (frontend changes don't affect Python tests)
---

## Iteration 7 - US-007 Add environment variables
- What was implemented: Added memory-related environment variables to .env.example and documented them in README
- Files changed:
  - .env.example (added MEMORY_API_URL, MEMORY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, ENABLE_MEMORY)
  - README.md (added Memory Integration section to Environment Variables table)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Environment variables are documentation-only at this stage - no code changes needed
  - README already had an Environment Variables section, just needed a subsection for memory
  - All 15 server tests still pass
